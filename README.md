# bossMachine
Repository for my CodeCademy project for learning Express, etc. The lesson itself is [here](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/create-a-back-end-app-with-javascript/tracks/bapi-learn-express/modules/boss-machine-project/informationals/bapi-p4-boss-machine), however a CodeCademy account is needed to access it. A starting set of files was downloaded from the lesson.
